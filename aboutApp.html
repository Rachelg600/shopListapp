    <h2>About the shared list</h2>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>Family members have difficulty keeping track of items to buy within the household, 
        resulting in items being duplicated or not being bought at all. Family members may ask  
        each other to help buy stuffs or look out for certain items at an upcoming sale. Currently 
        this is conveyed verbally or through Whatsapp. The person who is tasked to buy may forget 
        about it after a few days or be stressed to hunt for the item(s) on the very same day.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Target audience</h3>
    <p>The target group for the solution will start with a core group of family members who stay in
        the same household. Family members staying together are more likely to be buying items for each other. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Proposed solution</h3>
    <p>Modelled after a to-do list, this is a simple web-app for family members to share and track 
        their shopping list. Basic festures include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Input field for item description</li>
        <li>Drop-down list to select user; no creation of new user (yet) since this target audience is small</li>
        <li>Entries are auto date-stamped</li>
        <li>List displayed in a table that can be sorted (asc), e.g. to view items by user</li>
        <li>"X"" button to allow user to remove an item; alert is displayed to confirm removal</li>
        <li>Clear List button to allow user to clear entire list; alert is displayed to confirm removal</li>
        <li>Alert to add item description when "+" button is clicked without entry</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Future enhancement</h3>
    <p>The webapp could be improved in future: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow new users to be created</li>
        <li>Allow user login (but this reduce useability with additional step)</li>
        <li>Allow users to create multiple list, e.g. shopping list for upcoming overseas trip, shopping list for individual user</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Challenges faced in this exercise</h3>
    <p>Struggling with backend, especially node and ejs, and database deployment, so app currently depends on local storage to store the list. </p>
